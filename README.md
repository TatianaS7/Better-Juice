For this Capstone Project, I decided to base my website on a fresh juice brand. It came out pretty nice, but I did run into some issues. 

On the Shop page, I had an issue with aligning the product cards evenly; if you look closely, you can see the first two rows for Green Juice and Lemonade are not lined up.

Also, on the Home page, the three images under "Our Menu" are fixed to the very bottom of the page, which I couldnt fix, even after increasing the bottom margin.

Aside from the issues I faced, I had a really good time working on this project. I spent a lot of time on the Shop page, which was probably my favorite part. I love how the product cards came out, despite the alignment.
